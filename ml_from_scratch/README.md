# Machine Learning in Python From scratch 

A Vectorized Python üêç implementation using only [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) resembling **as closely as possible** to both provided and personally-completed code in the octave/matlab as part of the excellent Stanford University's Machine Learning Course on Coursera. 
The course is taught by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) a genius and an excellent popularizer, which is a rare combination.

## Supervised Learning
Given a set of labeled observations, find a function f which can be used to assign a class or value to unseen observations. Predictions should be similar to real labels.
### Regression
In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a **continuous output**, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.

### Classification 

In a classification problem, we instead are trying to predict results in a **discrete output**. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

## Unsupervised Learning
Labeling can be tedious (too long, too slow), often done by humans and no real labels to compare.
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.
We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables. We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

### Clustering
Group objects in clusters, similar within cluster, dissimilar between clusters.
