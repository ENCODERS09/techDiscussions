Hi @hzitoun,

We've just launched the Recruit Holding's Restaurant Visitor Forecasting Competition! Here are the competition details. If you're interested in competing, or digging deeper into the specifics, click the 'Join the competition' button below.

Host:
Recruit Holdings, a large Japanese company that owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software company).

Competition Description:
In this competition, you're challenged to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for specified future dates. This information will help restaurants more efficiently schedule employees and order ingredients, hopefully allowing them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.
